Scope - Scope is used to define filters that appear at the title bar in list view. Below is an example of Orders scope defined, and appears as a drop-down list of each scope defined.

// define scopes for Order
	for _, state := range []string{"checkout", "cancelled", "paid", "paid_cancelled", "processing", "shipped", "returned"} {
		var state = state
		order.Scope(&admin.Scope{
			Name:  state,
			Label: strings.Title(strings.Replace(state, "_", " ", -1)),
			Group: "Order Status",
			Handle: func(db *gorm.DB, context *qor.Context) *gorm.DB {
				return db.Where(models.Order{Transition: transition.Transition{State: state}})
			},
		})
	}
